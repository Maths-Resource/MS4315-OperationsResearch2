	\item Each of two supermarket chains proposes to 
	build a store in a rural region that is served by three towns. The distances between towns are 
	shown in the figure below.\begin{figure}[h!]

	\end{figure}
	
	\item Approximately 43 percent of the. regiions population live near town A, 33 
	percent live near town B. and 70 percent live near town C. 
	\item Because Chain 1 is larger and has 
	developed a better reputation than chain 2. chain 1 will control a majority of the business 
	whenever their situations are comparable. 
	\item 
	Both chains are aware of the other's interest in the region and both have completed marketing surveys that give identical projections.
	\item  If 
	both chains locate in the same town or equidistant from a town, chain 1 will control 65 percent of the business in that town. 
	\item
	If chain I 1 closer to a town than chain 2. chain I will control 90 mem of that towns business. 
	\item If chain 1 is farther from a town 
	than chain 2, it will still draw 40 percent of that town's business, The remaining business under all circumstances will go to chain 2. 
	\item Furthermore, both chains know that it is the policy of chain I not to locate in towns that are too small, and town C falls into this category.
