\item  Consider the following game. Player 1 moves first and can take action A or B.
 Player 2 observes the action of Player 1 and independently of the action of Player 1 can
 take action A or B. If both play A, then Player 1 obtains a payoff of 4 and Player 2
 obtains a payoff of 5. If Player 1 plays A and Player 2 plays B, then Player 1 obtains a
 payoff of 2 and Player 2 obtains a payoff of 7. If Player 1 plays B and Player 2 plays A,
