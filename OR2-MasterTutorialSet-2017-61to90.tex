  \item OBKB Investments is considering investments into 5 projects: A, B, C, D, and E.
  
  Each project has an initial cost, an expected profit rate (one year from now) expressed as a
  percentage of the initial cost, and an associated risk of failure.

\item 
The \textbf{Nelson Rules} are a set of eight decision rules for detecting ``out-of-control" or non-random conditions on control charts. These rules are applied to a control chart on which the magnitude of some variable is plotted against time. The rules are based on the mean value and the standard deviation of the samples.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Discuss any four of these rules, and how they would be used to detect ``out of control" processes. Support your answer with sketch.
